## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I follow myself?**
A: No, the system prevents self-following.

**Q: What happens if I reject a request?**
A: The request is marked as REJECTED and removed from your pending list. The sender can send a new request later.

**Q: What's the difference between Following and Connected?**
A: Following means you sent/accepted a request. Connected means BOTH users are following each other (mutual).

**Q: Can I see who rejected my request?**
A: No, rejections are private. The button will just reset to "Follow" state.

**Q: How are mutual connections calculated?**
A: The system finds the intersection of your connections and the other user's connections.

**Q: Can I undo an unfollow?**
A: Yes, you can send a new follow request after unfollowing.
